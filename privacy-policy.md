# SMS Forge Privacy Policy, Data Retention and Permissions

This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application **SMS Forge**, developed by **Theliel**, collects, uses, and protects your information.

**SMS Forge** is designed to respect your privacy. The application does not require internet access and does not collect any personal user information unless you actively choose to use a specific debugging feature.

## Information Collected
The **SMS Forge** application only collects the following information when the user enables the **debugging** option. All data is obfuscated and stored only locally on the user's device.

The data that may be collected includes:

* **General device information:** Model, brand, and operating system to understand the application's environment.
* **SMS information:** The messages sent from the application, as well as the settings and parameters used for their delivery.
* **Diagnostic and error data:** Information about potential app failures or errors to aid in troubleshooting and bug fixing.

## How and Why I Collect Information

The information mentioned above is collected **solely and exclusively** for the purpose of **diagnosing and fixing application errors**, and to improve the user experience.

Data collection for debugging is **completely optional**. The user must enable this function manually. Once the data is collected locally, the user has the option to send an encrypted log file to the developer by email for analysis. The application will not send this information automatically.

## Data Storage and Security

All information collected by the debugging feature is stored securely and **only locally** on the user's device. The application does not transmit this information to any server or any other location.

The information collected for debugging is **automatically deleted** from the device the moment the user disables the debugging option.

Additionally, if the user decides to explicitly send this data to the developer, the developer commits to **deleting said information within a maximum of 30 days** after receiving it, once it has been used for diagnostic and error correction purposes.

## Permissions

SMS Forge is designed with user privacy as a priority. The application does not connect to the Internet and does not require network access. The only exception to this is, naturally, the connection to Google's servers for all functionalities directly or indirectly related to the complete unlocking/purchase of the Application, which requires a network connection. The application's permissions are minimal and strictly limited to its core functionality:

* Root Permissions: Required for the basic functioning of the App, enabling direct access to the device's modem.
* Contacts Access: Used solely to quickly and conveniently select a recipient for your message from your device's address book.
* Internet Access: Delegated solely by Google's own billing services, and only for that purpose

System API Status: Currently, SMS Forge does not request standard SMS send permissions (like SEND_SMS) as it bypasses the system's SMS APIs entirely, communicating directly with the modem. However, in future updates, these system permissions may be requested to expand possibilities, such as SMS delivery confirmation or advanced message processing.

## Third-Party Services

**SMS Forge** uses **Google Play Services** to manage in-app purchases. Google Play Services has its own Privacy Policy, which you can consult on their website. 

The application does not share any user information with other third parties.
